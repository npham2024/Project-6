# Project-6 P1 and P2

## P1
### P1/15.18 LAB: Pug Templates and JavaScript
- Used PUG templates in order to render hmtl. Template 1 was simple where it was just nested elements.
- Template 2 was tricky because unlike javascript for loops the `each in` syntax switches the key and value pairs. 
- Template 3 used mixins which was simple enough. Essentially like a function in javascript.
- Template 4 was more involved with mixins using an array of objects from javascript and a for loop to display the information

### P1/17.10 LAB: Saving the Planet Accessibly
- This lab was pretty straight forward. Just followed the directions and made the correction that were asked in order for the website to be more accessible.
- However unable to get a 10/10 because of `Line 141, column 27: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getAttribute')` error
